If height is measured in centimeters (ratio data), you can correctly state that one group's average height is twice as much as the other's.

They provide valuable insights into the center and spread of the data. Here are some common measures of central tendency and variability, along with explanations of how each measure can be used to describe a dataset:-\n",
    "     * Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "        * Mean (Average):-The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of data points.\n",
    "          * Use: The mean represents the arithmetic average of the data. It provides a measure of the central or typical value in the dataset. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "       * Median:-The median is the middle value when the data is ordered from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest). If there's an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "         * Use: The median is a measure of central tendency that is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean. It represents the middle value and is especially useful when dealing with skewed data.\n",
    "       * Mode:-The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "         * Use: The mode identifies the most common value(s) in the dataset. It is particularly useful for categorical or discrete data and can be used to describe the most frequently occurring category.\n",
    "    * Measures of Variability:\n",
    "      * Variance:-Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It quantifies the average deviation of data points from the mean.\n",
    "        * Use: Variance provides a measure of data dispersion. A higher variance indicates greater variability, while a lower variance suggests data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "       * Standard Deviation:-The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation from the mean in the original units of measurement.\n",
    "         * Use: Standard deviation is commonly used because it is in the same units as the data. It provides a more interpretable measure of spread compared to variance."
