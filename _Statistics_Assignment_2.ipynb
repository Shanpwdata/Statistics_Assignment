They provide insights into the variability or the extent to which data points deviate from the central tendency (e.g., mean or median). Let's explore each of these measures and provide an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Range:- The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "    * Formula: Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value\n",
    "    * Example: Consider a dataset of daily temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit) for a city over a week: [60, 65, 68, 72, 75, 80, 85]. The range would be 85 (maximum) - 60 (minimum) = 25 degrees Fahrenheit. This indicates that the temperatures vary by 25 degrees over the week.\n",
    "  * Variance:- Variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "    * Formula: Variance = Σ (xi - x̄)² / (n - 1), where xi is each data point, x̄ is the mean, and n is the number of data points.\n",
    "    * Example: Let's use the same dataset of daily temperatures. First, calculate the mean (x̄) as (60 + 65 + 68 + 72 + 75 + 80 + 85) / 7 = 71.14 (approximately). Then, calculate the variance using the formula. The variance would be a numerical value that quantifies how the temperatures deviate from the mean.\n",
    "  * Standard Deviation:- The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "    * Formula: Standard Deviation = √Variance\n",
    "    * Example: Continuing with the temperature dataset, once you've calculated the variance, you can find the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance. This value represents how much the daily temperatures typically deviate from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the example, the range tells you the extent of temperature variation, but it doesn't provide information about the distribution of those variations. Variance and standard deviation, on the other hand, quantify the spread while considering the magnitude of each deviation. A larger standard deviation implies more significant variability, while a smaller one suggests less variability."
